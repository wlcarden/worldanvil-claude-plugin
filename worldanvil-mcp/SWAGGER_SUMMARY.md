## Why This Matters

1. **Our original POST implementation was CORRECT** ✅
2. **The @crit-fumble package using GET is WRONG** ❌ (explains why it doesn't work)
3. **This is a non-standard but valid API design** - WorldAnvil uses POST for queries/lists

## API Design Pattern

WorldAnvil follows this pattern:
- **GET** with `?id=xxx` - Retrieve single resource
- **POST** with body `{world_id: xxx}` or similar - Query/list resources
- **PUT** - Create new resource
- **PATCH** - Update existing resource
- **DELETE** - Remove resource

This is different from REST conventions but is documented and intentional.
